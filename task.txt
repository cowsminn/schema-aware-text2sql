T1 – Text-To-Sql

Build a multi-step chain (using LangChain or other libraries at your choice) that:
    • Accepts an NLP question,
    • Generates a SQL query,
    • Executes it,
    • Summarizes the result in natural language.

You should:
Handle ambiguous or vague NLP input 
    • use prompt engineering or schema-aware techniques to guide the LLM
    • include schema context in the prompt;

Compare SQL query generation across different LLMs
    • evaluate differences in query accuracy, syntax, and logic;

Handle errors and optimize using feedback
    • add mechanisms to detect and correct invalid SQL
    • implement user feedback loop (e.g., thumbs up/down, corrections)
    • optionally explore few-shot or chain-of-thought prompting

Test the solution on known benchmarks
    • Use Spider or Bird to measure Exact match accuracy and Execution accuracy.
Add UI (optional): simple web or CLI interface.

Repository must include:
    • Functional source code
    • A README/wiki containing:
        ◦ Technical documentation: system architecture, data model, software/hardware configurations, VM usage (if any), tool versions, relevant code snippets, screenshots of code execution and tool outputs, tabular comparisons of results/tools, interpretations, and bibliographic references (properly cited in-text).
        ◦ Diagrams must be created using dedicated tools (e.g. https://app.diagrams.net, https://www.lucidchart.com, yEd, Microsoft Visio, etc.). Hand-drawn or scanned images are not accepted.
    • A presentation (PowerPoint, Keynote, Canva, Remark.js + Markdown + KaTeX, etc.) summarizing the documentation (max. 10 slides).
    • Video demonstrations of code execution (e.g. YouTube, Microsoft Stream).
